An old game I made in highschool

I apologize for the bad formatting and file structure (or lack of). This is a game I made in my senior year of highschool, and I was pretty proud of it. To play the game, you just need to clone this repository, and run the Game.java file. However a small issue I realize now is that I hard coded my game to work for only my computers monitor resolution of 2560x1980. I'm sorry if it doesn't work on other computers, and I don't feel the incentive to fix it.
